# WORKLOG

Session-level record of work done in this repo: what changed, why, and the
exact commands/tools used to verify it. One entry per work session. Do not
backfill entries for work that wasn't actually verified in that session — if
something is unverified, say so.

Older work is recorded in `git log` (commit messages from 2026-05-31 onward
are detailed) and in the two audit reports at the repo root
(`underfireai-audit-2026-05-31.md`, `underfireai-audit-checklist-v1.md`).
This log starts from the point CI + worklog tooling was introduced rather
than reconstructing history that already exists elsewhere.

## 2026-06-22 — Add CI pipeline and work-documentation system

**What:** Added a GitHub Actions workflow, this worklog, and CHANGELOG.md.
Updated CLAUDE.md to require future sessions to keep this file current.

**Why:** Lint/typecheck/test were being run manually and inconsistently —
nothing in the repo guaranteed they happened. There was also no standing
record of session-level work (only git commit messages, which only go back
to 2026-05-31 in detailed form).

**Tools/commands run:**
- `npm install @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu --no-save` — local sandbox-only
  fix for a missing native binding (this sandbox's `node_modules` was
  installed on Windows and mounted into a Linux shell; not expected to recur
  on a real Linux CI runner doing a fresh `npm ci`). Not committed —
  `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` were not modified.
- `npx vitest run` — 2 test files, 23 tests, all passing.
- `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) — clean, no errors.
- `npm run lint` (`next lint`) — "No ESLint warnings or errors."

**Result:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` added (runs typecheck + lint + unit
tests on push/PR to `main`). `WORKLOG.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` added.
`CLAUDE.md` updated with a documentation-maintenance rule.

**Known limitations:**
- CI has not run yet — it only takes effect once this is pushed to GitHub.
  The first real run on GitHub's runners is unverified.
- E2E (Playwright) is intentionally not in CI yet — it boots a live dev
  server against real Supabase/Stripe/OpenAI config, which isn't safe to
  run unattended without a dedicated staging environment and secrets. Not
  done here; flagged as a follow-up.
- No pre-commit hook was added (CI-only enforcement was the chosen approach
  for this round, not local hooks).
